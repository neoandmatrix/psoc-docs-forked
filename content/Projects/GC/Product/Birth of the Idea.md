The idea for our broadcast system project emerged from our observations of live cricket tournaments at our college. While third-party apps like _CricHeroes_ were used for real-time scores, they failed to meet the specific needs of our tournaments. We saw an opportunity to build a custom solution that would align with our college's technical identity and foster innovation. The project aims to create a real-time, scalable platform for streaming live scores, with role-based access for players, organizers, and spectators. It will also include tools for tournament management and analytics.

This project offers a unique learning experience, involving backend and frontend development, real-time data processing, and system architecture. It aligns with our ethos of self-reliance and would demonstrate our community's technical capabilities. Beyond just streaming scores, the platform will integrate with other college systems, contributing to our campus infrastructure.

By tackling the challenges of real-time performance and scalability, this project will foster a culture of collaboration and innovation. It will not only solve a current problem but also create a legacy of technical achievement, teamwork, and the belief that technology can solve real-world problems.
