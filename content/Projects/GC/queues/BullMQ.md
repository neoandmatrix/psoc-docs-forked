## Introduction

### Queue

A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. In computing, queues are widely used for managing asynchronous operations, task scheduling, and buffering data between processes. The primary operations in a queue are enqueue (adding elements) and dequeue (removing elements), both typically having O(1) time complexity. Queues play a crucial role in message brokers, event processing systems, and job scheduling frameworks.

### BullMQ

BullMQ is a modern, Redis-based queue system designed specifically for Node.js applications. It excels at handling distributed job processing with features like job prioritization, delayed jobs, job retries, and rate limiting. BullMQ supports multiple producers and consumers, making it ideal for microservices architectures. Unlike simple in-memory queues, BullMQ provides persistence, ensuring jobs aren't lost even if the application crashes. Its event-driven architecture allows developers to track job progress, handle failures gracefully, and implement complex workflow patterns. BullMQ's robust concurrency model helps prevent race conditions and ensures reliable job processing in high-throughput scenarios.
