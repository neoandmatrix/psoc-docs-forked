This diagram illustrates the architecture and flow of an OTP (One-Time Password) generation and verification system. The system ensures secure email-based OTP delivery and verification, leveraging Redis for temporary storage and a Bull queue for job processing.

## Components and Flow

### 1. **User Interaction**

- **Generate OTP:**
    - The user initiates the OTP generation process by hitting the `otp/generate` endpoint (a POST request).
- **Verify OTP:**
    - Once the user receives the OTP via email, they enter it and call the `otp/verify` endpoint (a POST request) for verification.

### 2. **Generate OTP Endpoint**

- When the user calls the `otp/generate` endpoint:
    1. A request is sent to the **Bull Queue Producer**, which is responsible for queuing the task.
    2. The Bull Queue Producer adds the job to the **OTP Jobs Queue**.
    3. The expected body is 
       ```json
       {
	       email : "example@gamil.com"
       }
       ```

### 3. **OTP Jobs Queue**

- The **OTP Jobs Queue** acts as a middleware between job creation and processing. It:
    1. Receives queued tasks from the Bull Queue Producer.
    2. Passes the tasks to the **Processor** for execution.

### 4. **Processor**

- The **Processor** is a critical component responsible for:
    1. Generating the OTP.
    2. Temporarily storing the OTP in Redis with a **Time-to-Live (TTL)** value with 10 minute expiry.
    3. Forwarding the OTP and email details to the **Mailer**.

### 5. **Mailer**

- The **Mailer** calls an external email service to send the generated OTP to the userâ€™s submitted email address. Once the email is sent:
    1. The mailer service uses an `otp.hbs` file for the mail template located in mailer folder.
    2. The OTP is stored in Redis (TTL ensures automatic deletion after expiry).
    4. A success acknowledgment is returned.

### 6. **Verify OTP Endpoint**

- The `otp/verify` endpoint:
    1. Retrieves the user-submitted OTP.
    2. Checks the OTP stored in Redis.
    3. If the OTP matches and is valid (not expired), it returns a positive response (e.g., `OTP is correct`).
    4. If the OTP does not match or is expired, it returns an error response (e.g., `OTP is incorrect`). 
    5. Expected payload in body 
       ```json
       {
	       email : "test@gmail.com",
	       otp : "456123"
       }
```
