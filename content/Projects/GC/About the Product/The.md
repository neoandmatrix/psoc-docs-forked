### Functional Requirements
# **User Management**

### **Player Registrations, Audience Access, and Profiles**

Players will undergo a progressive registration process, ensuring their profiles are built and updated gradually as they engage with the application. This allows for a personalized experience, where information is captured over time based on the player's interaction with the platform.

During registration, players will be required to provide the following essential details:

- **First Name**
- **Middle Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Phone Number**
- **Valid College Email ID ( ending with *@iiit-bh.ac.in)
- **Gender**
- **Batch**
- **Branch**

Additionally, players have the option to include their social media profiles (e.g., links to their social handles), although this is not mandatory.

The **branch** field is particularly sensitive. In case of any changes, such as a branch transfer, players can raise an issue, which will be reviewed and resolved by `SUPERADMIN` to ensure that all information remains accurate.

Future updates will introduce [[Form Fields]]


#after-registration
After registration, players will initially have access similar to that of an unauthorized **Audience**. However, they will have additional capabilities that enhance their engagement and participation within the platform.

### **Players can:**

- **Change their profile**: Players can update and modify their personal details, such as their name, contact information, and other profile settings, ensuring their information is always up-to-date.
- **Request to join teams**: Players can express interest in joining specific teams, allowing for seamless integration into team-based activities and events.
- **Leave a team**: Players have the ability to request to leave a team, providing them with control over their participation and team affiliations.
- **Team Actions**: Players can take actions related to team management, such as requesting team membership or initiating team changes, all within the context of the platformâ€™s team structure.

### **Future Scope:**

- **Self-Review**: In the future, players will have the ability to self-review their performance, gaining insights into their contributions and progress. This feature will help players evaluate their skills and growth, fostering a more self-driven approach to improvement.
superadmin POV: 

- change 



- create profile 

#### **For the Audience**

- For users who wish to explore the application without full registration, the platform provides a public view system. This allows audience members to browse content such as match updates, team information, and live scores without the need for a personal profile.
- The philosophy behind this is to foster open access and inclusivity, enabling anyone to engage with the platform casually before deciding to create a more personalized profile. This approach ensures that the application is accessible to all users, whether they are looking for quick information or seeking a more tailored experience as a player or participant.
