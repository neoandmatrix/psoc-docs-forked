The product consists of three main components:

The product consists of three core components, each designed to cater to different user needs and administrative roles. The **Mobile Application / Webview** serves as the main interface for the audience and players. It provides a platform for the audience to view live scores, match updates, and other event-related information. Players can also use this component to manage and update their personal profiles, offering a dynamic and engaging experience for those actively participating in the events.

The second component is the **Web Application (Superadmin Panel)**, which offers the Superadmin full control over the entire system. Through this panel, the Superadmin can manage and configure match listings, oversee user accounts, and handle other critical system operations such as session management and security settings. This ensures that the system runs smoothly and allows the Superadmin to make real-time adjustments as necessary.

Lastly, the **Admin Application / Webview** is designed for administrators responsible for updating match scores in real-time. This interface enables admins to input, modify, and track scores as the matches progress, ensuring that all data remains accurate and up-to-date. The Admin Application plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and flow of live events, ensuring that users and players have access to the latest match information.

### **Player Registrations, Audience Access, and Profiles**

Players will undergo a progressive registration process, ensuring their profiles are built and updated gradually as they engage with the application. This allows for a personalized experience, where information is captured over time based on the player's interaction with the platform.

During registration, players will be required to provide the following essential details:

- **First Name**
- **Middle Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Phone Number**
- **Valid College Email ID ( ending with *@iiit-bh.ac.in)
- **Gender**
- **Batch**
- **Branch**

Additionally, players have the option to include their social media profiles (e.g., links to their social handles), although this is not mandatory.

The **branch** field is particularly sensitive. In case of any changes, such as a branch transfer, players can raise an issue, which will be reviewed and resolved by `SUPERADMIN` to ensure that all information remains accurate.

Future updates will introduce [[Form Fields]]
# After Registration
After registration, players will initially have access similar to that of an unauthorized **AUDIENCE**. However, they will have additional capabilities that enhance their engagement and participation within the platform.

### **Players can:**

- **Change their profile**
- **Request to join teams**: Players can express interest in joining specific teams, which can be then approved / rejected by **Team Captains** ( more about this , later).
- **Leave a team**

#future-scope
- **Self-Review**: In the future, players will have the ability to self-review their performance, gaining insights into their contributions and progress. This feature will help players evaluate their skills and growth, fostering a more self-driven approach to improvement.

#### **For the Audience**

- For users who wish to explore the application without full registration, the platform provides a public view system. This allows audience members to browse content such as match updates, team information, and live scores without the need for a personal profile.
- The philosophy behind this is to foster open access and inclusivity, enabling anyone to engage with the platform casually before deciding to create a more personalized profile. This approach ensures that the application is accessible to all users, whether they are looking for quick information or seeking a more tailored experience as a player or participant.
