### Journey

Upon registering in the application, a [[User]] creates a profile that contains specific details related to the sport they play. A user can have multiple profiles if they participate in more than one sport. When requesting to join a team, the user selects one of their profiles, which can then be reviewed by the team [[Captains|Captain]] before approval. This ensures that the playerâ€™s qualifications and experience are properly considered.
### Access Control

- **User Players**: Can create, edit, and delete their own profiles.
- **Admins**: Have the ability to edit or delete any profiles across the platform.
- **Captains**: As an elevated form of player, captains can create and assign profiles to players within their team.
