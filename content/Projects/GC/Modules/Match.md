### Journey 

The journey of a match begins when admins create and manage match details through the admin panel. Admins are responsible for filling in key information such as the teams, squad assignments, venue, date, and the match's status. Once created, matches are visible to the audience and users, who can view upcoming and past matches but cannot modify any details. Admins also have the authority to assign umpires to the match, who are responsible for officiating, updating scores, and other related tasks. The match lifecycle is fully controlled by admins, who can edit, reschedule, or cancel matches as necessary to ensure smooth operations.
