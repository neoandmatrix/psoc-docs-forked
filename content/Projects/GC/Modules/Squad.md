### Journey

Admins are responsible for creating squads that will participate in the tournament and appointing [[Captains]] for each squad. The squad captain plays a role in managing and leading the squad throughout the tournament.

[[Captains]] have additional responsibilities, including approving or rejecting requests from [[User|Players]] (users) who wish to join a squad. Once a player is approved, they become part of the squad's pool. From this pool, captains can create [[Team]].

For example, in a cricket match, a captain may accept 20 players into the squad and then select the final team of 11 players For a particular match from these players.

### Access Control

- **Admins**: Have full control over squads, including the ability to create, edit, and delete them.
- **Captains**: Can edit the details of their own squad and manage player requests, including approving or rejecting players. Captains also select the final team from the approved squad members.
