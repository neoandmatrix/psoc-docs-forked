### Journey

Admins are responsible for creating squads that will participate in the tournament and appointing a captain for each squad. The squad captain plays a crucial role in leading and managing the squad throughout the tournament.

- captains can also approve ,reject the requests sent by players (user ) that want to join a squad. these squad - players are then used as a pool of players from which a captain creates a team
eg: assume cricket match, captain accepts 20 players from the requests 
he /she further creates team 

### Access Control
