The role of the [[Umpiring|Umpire]] is crucial for ensuring the smooth conduct of matches. This feature enables the admin to assign umpire duties to [[User|Players]] from a pool of eligible candidates based on specific criteria, such as fair play guidelines of GC and availability. This system ensures that only qualified players are promoted to the umpire role, with an emphasis on fair play.
#### Process of Assigning Umpires

1. **Eligibility Criteria**:
    
    - From the pool of players, the admin filters candidates based on fair play guidelines. These criteria could include a player's conduct, performance, and participation history, ensuring that only those who meet the required standards are considered for the umpire role.
1. **Selection of Umpires**:
    
    - Admins review the list of eligible players and select those they deem fit for umpiring the match. Umpires are selected based on their qualifications, experience, and role in maintaining the integrity of the game.
3. **Roles and Responsibilities of Umpires**:
    
    - **Score Updating**: One of the primary responsibilities of an umpire is to update the match scores in real-time.
    - **Match Control**: Umpires ensure the rules of the game are followed, make decisions on disputes, and control the flow of the match.
    - **Timekeeping**: Umpires may be responsible for ensuring that the match proceeds within the allotted time.
    - **Player Behavior Monitoring**: Umpires are also tasked with monitoring player conduct, issuing warnings or penalties as required for violations of the rules.
    - **Match Reporting**: Umpires are responsible for generating match reports, documenting key events, scores, and outcomes.
4. **Time-Limited Umpire Role (TTL)**:
    
    - The umpire role assigned to a player is temporary and governed by a Time To Live (TTL) policy. This ensures that players are given umpire responsibilities only for the duration of the match or a specific time period defined by the admin.
    - **TTL Expiry**: After the TTL expires, the player's status is reverted to that of a regular user, ensuring that the umpire role is only maintained as long as necessary.
5. **Automatic Role Reversion**:
    
    - When the TTL expires, the player’s umpire status is automatically revoked, and they return to their original user role. This automatic change ensures fairness and ensures that umpire duties are only assigned for the appropriate period.
