### Journey

The application begins with users entering as **Unauthorized users**, referred to as the **[[Audience]]**. For players to onboard into the system, they must first register by providing specific details. These details are outlined in the **[[Requirement#^11b4bc|Player Registration Requirements]]**. Once registered, players become part of the pool from which [[Captains]] and admins can create and manage [[Team]], appoint [[Captains]], assign players to [[Squad]], and set up [[Match]]. This process helps in building the structure of the game, ensuring players are on boarded properly before they are involved in any team-based activities.

### Access Control

- **Users**: Can create their own accounts and register by providing the required details, thereby onboarding themselves into the application.
- **Admins**: Have the authority to enable, disable, or delete user accounts as necessary. Admins also manage user access and can modify account statuses.
- **Users**: Can update their personal details after registration to ensure their profile remains accurate and up-to-date.
