### Journey

Admins assign [[Squad]] [[Captains]], who are then responsible for building the teams for each [[Match]]. The captains create teams by selecting [[User|Players]] from their squad and adding necessary details, such as the team name and match-specific information. Once a team is created, captains can also edit or delete teams as needed, ensuring that the teams are properly set up for each match.

### Access Control

- **Admins**: Can assign squad captains and oversee team creation, edits, and deletions.
- **Captains**: Can create, edit, and delete teams within their squad for a specific match.
