**[[Squads]]** are groups of [[User|Players]] formed to compete in a specific tournament or [[Match]]. Admins play a key role in creating and managing squads, including appointing a squad [[Captains|Captain]] who will be responsible for leading the team throughout the tournament. A squad can consist of multiple players who are selected based on their profiles and performance, and the squad captain has the authority to approve or reject player requests to join the squad.

Squads serve as a foundational element for building teams. After players join a squad, the captain can further organize them into teams for specific matches. The captain's role extends beyond team formation; they are responsible for ensuring the squad is well-prepared, coordinating player availability, and maintaining overall team dynamics.

### Key Squad Features:

- **Creation & Management**: Admins have full control over squad creation, editing, and deletion.
- **Captain Appointment**: Admins assign captains to squads, who then manage the squad and lead them during the tournament.
- **Player Requests**: Players can request to join squads, with the captain reviewing and approving these requests.
- **Team Formation**: After approving players, the captain can form teams from the squad to participate in specific matches.
