In the application, **[[Match]]** represent the core events in a tournament where [[Team|Teams]] compete against each other. A match is created by an admin and includes important details such as the teams involved, the squad members, venue, date, and status of the match. These details are managed throughout the match lifecycle, from scheduling to final results.

Admins have full control over the creation, editing, and deletion of matches, ensuring that match schedules are properly set, adjusted, or canceled if necessary. Once a match is created, it is made visible to the audience and users, allowing them to view upcoming and past match details, including the teams, venue, and date.

Matches also require the appointment of [[Umpire Assignment - Promote Player with TTL|Umpires]], who are responsible for updating scores and managing other game-related tasks. Umpires are selected from a pool of players by admins, based on FPP (Fair Play Policies) of GC and are given temporary umpire status, which expires after a set period.
