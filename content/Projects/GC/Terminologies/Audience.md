In the context of the application, **Audience** refers to users who have not yet registered or logged in. These individuals have limited access to the platform, primarily allowing them to view general information, such as upcoming and past [[Match]]. They are considered "unauthorized" users in the system and cannot interact with features that require authentication, such as creating [[Team]], editing [[Profile]], or participating in [[Match]].

The Audience role is typically the first point of contact for users before they decide to register and become players. This status ensures that the system remains secure by restricting access to certain functionalities until a user has registered and logged in.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Can only view general match details and public content.
- Cannot modify or interact with the system's core functionalities (e.g., creating teams, joining squads).
- Transition to a "Player" status occurs after registration and successful onboarding.

This system allows for a seamless transition from passive users (audience) to active participants (players), with appropriate permissions granted as users engage more with the platform.
