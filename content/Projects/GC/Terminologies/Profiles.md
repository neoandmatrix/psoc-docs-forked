**[[Profile]]** in the application represent individual user identities tailored to the specific sport they play. Upon registration, users create a profile that includes essential details like their sport, skill level, and other personal information. A user can have multiple profiles if they participate in more than one sport. This flexibility allows players to be involved in various teams across different sports, all while maintaining separate identities for each.

Profiles are crucial for [[Captains|Team Captains]] and admins when managing [[Team]] rosters. When a player requests to join a team, they select one of their profiles, which the captain reviews before approval. This ensures that only suitable [[User|Player]] are added to teams based on their profiles and performance history.

### Key Profile Features:

- **Creation & Editing**: Players can create, edit, and delete their own profiles, providing relevant details about their involvement in a particular sport.
- **Multiple Profiles**: A single user can have multiple profiles, one for each sport they are part of.
- **Profile Approval**: Captains can review and approve player profiles when adding them to a team.
- **Admin Control**: Admins have the authority to edit or delete any user profile when necessary.
