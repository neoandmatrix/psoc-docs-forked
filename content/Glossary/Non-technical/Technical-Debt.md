The cost of suboptimal, rushed, or poorly structured code that prioritizes short-term delivery over long-term maintainability. It creates bottlenecks, bugs, and scaling challenges, increasing the effort and complexity of future development. Focusing on "just making it work" rather than thinking extensively and writing with future implications in mind.
