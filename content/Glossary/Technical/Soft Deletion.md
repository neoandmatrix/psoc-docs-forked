Soft deletion is a technique used in databases where data is marked as deleted but not actually removed from the system. Instead of permanently deleting a record, a "deleted" flag or timestamp is added to it, indicating that the record is no longer active or in use. This allows the data to be retained for historical purposes or potential recovery, while preventing it from appearing in active queries or being accessed by users. Soft deletion provides a way to recover deleted data if necessary, offering an additional layer of protection and flexibility in managing records.

Soft deletion plays a crucial role in optimizing database performance and management. By marking records as deleted rather than physically removing them, it helps reduce the need for frequent tree rebalances in databases, particularly in systems that use index-based data structures like B-trees. When records are deleted, the tree structure may need to be reorganized to maintain balance, which can be resource-intensive. With soft deletion, this rebalancing is avoided, as the records remain in place, only hidden from active queries.

Soft deletion can ease the workload on database engines. Since the data isn't actually removed, the database doesn't need to perform expensive operations to physically delete and reclaim storage space. This allows the system to handle more transactions efficiently, without the overhead of constantly adjusting storage or re-indexing after deletions.

From an audit perspective, soft deletion is particularly valuable. It provides a clear, traceable record of what data was marked as deleted and when, without actually losing the information. This is essential for maintaining data integrity and compliance, especially in systems that require audit trails for legal or regulatory purposes. By keeping deleted records accessible, soft deletion enables administrators to review and recover data if necessary, supporting transparency and accountability in data management.
