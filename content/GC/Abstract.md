The Grand Championship Broadcasting System (GCBS) was conceptualized in  as a solution to address the growing need for real-time broadcasting of sports events at IIIT-Bhubaneswar. Inspired by the college's annual sports event, where thousands of students participate in various competitions, the idea emerged to create a platform capable of providing live score updates, event tracking, and seamless communication among all stakeholders, including participants, spectators, and administrators.

The goal was to bridge the gap between the live action happening on the field and the audience, providing a real-time, interactive experience that would enhance engagement and keep viewers informed. This led to the development of GCBS, a robust, real-time broadcasting system designed to manage and stream live scores, match updates, and event details.

GCBS integrates various technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient flow of information. Built with a combination of **Golang**, **Kafka**, **MongoDB**, **WebSockets (WS)**, and **Redis**, the system is designed to handle high-throughput data streams and real-time communication. The web platform, built with **Next.js**, provides a dynamic and responsive interface for users, while the mobile application, developed with **Flutter**, ensures that users can stay connected and updated on the go.

The core features of GCBS include user authentication with OTP for secure access, role-based access control (RBAC) to manage different user privileges, and real-time updates for match scores and events. Administrators and superadmins have the ability to manage users, teams, squads, and match-related data, ensuring smooth event execution. The system also supports CRUD operations for managing match scores, events, and player/team details.

In addition to the basic functionalities, GCBS introduces features like **team and squad management**, **match scheduling**, and **admin capabilities** for adding teams, captains, tournament details, and more. The platform is built with scalability in mind, ensuring that it can handle large-scale events, such as inter-college tournaments or university-wide sports meets, with ease.

The GCBS project not only showcases the technical prowess of IIIT-Bhubaneswar's students but also aims to revolutionize the way sports events are broadcasted and experienced by participants and audiences alike. By leveraging modern web and mobile technologies, the system delivers an immersive, interactive, and engaging experience that enhances the excitement of live sports events and provides valuable insights to viewers, organizers, and players.

Through this project, the team aims to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient solution that can be adapted to future sports events and expanded to include more advanced features, such as real-time analytics, video streaming, and fan engagement tools, making it a powerful tool for the future of sports broadcasting.
